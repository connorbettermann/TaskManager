The purpose of this program is to provide the user with a study guide aid. 
The user will be able to add topic of Information to a list and then
within each topic, statement will be inserted to be studied. These 
statements will hold an importance value to declare how important 
the information is. Operator overloading has also been implemented
throughout the program in an effort to simplify the code, and make
further additions an easier experience.
